    I miss you. you said you went to sleep. I hope and pray you stop feeling sad. You deserve to never feel sad. I wish i could take your sadness away. i hope and pray we can get the house with the apartments it would be so cool and wed have an option of a place for you if we're together. mannnn i miss you:( IM OBSESSED WITH SONGS THAT MAKE ME FEEL LIKE IM IN A PRINCESS OR IN A FANTASY WORLD HAHAH. I wish i was a fictional character. real life isnt the bestest sometimes. I want to start over. I think im a mess. I wish you met me while i wasnt this way. I was better before. <br> i always feel so anxious i feel like im not good enough and its actually killing me and idk what to do about it.
