  edit at 1:57pm<br> i miss you. so much. i hope youre doing great. I bit my tongue and it hurts. I talked to a new girl today. i left college early. Im not feeling good. Im home now. I was gifted vintage plates a couple years ago by an old lady and I dropped them today. It actually hurt and im crying while I type this. I also cut myself. It reminded me of the nana scene when she lost her best friend and then her favorite cup fell and broke üò≠ üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I lost my best friend and then my favorite plates broke. I didn‚Äôt get enough sleep last night. I feel weak. I feel like nothing goes well for me. ill try to be more positive on here and just in general. im too negative.<br><br>
  i put tretinoin on my skin after crying on accident which is a bad idea cause it might irritate my skin:( i was texting this to you but i didnt. i really liked the movie ivanhoe. i think ivan is such a pretty name. im gonna name my parrot ivan if its a boy or ivy if its a girl üò≠ i miss you. tbh leaving you is one of the hardest things. my heart wants you so bad but my brain knows what i need. im gonna trust my brain. i keep hearing fake notifications. im going to cali in july. i dont really like california. its too expensive. my favorite person is there. i hope somehow we bump imto each other. i also forgot to answer your question a couple hours ago. you asked me what my biggest project had been for sewing. it was a cosplay of a charcter called raven from ever after high. i made her entire outfit myself even her shoes. the shoes were so hard to make but everyoje liked it and said i did great üòº im actually good at making clothes and shoes. i have about 5 pairs of shoes that i made for myself. i hope one day i can show you. i always look at your drawings. theyre my favorite. your cloud pictures as well. it feels like seeing the world from your pov. anyone that sees them is so lucky. im gonna sleep now:) goodnight pretty boy<3

edit at 10:43PM perch<br> register:3 i cant sleep:/ i hope youre doing amazing. im making playlistsüíÄ im convinced that a movie about me would be so interestjng youd be the love interest. i have the plot planned out and everything (im making it up rn) It's the 1600s and im a hot girl that just so happens to be smart and everyone accuses me of being a witch even a cute guy (you) then eventually youre like shes kinda hot im in love with her and you start defending me but they end up burning me at the stake anyway:(<br><br> goodnight ivan<3 im gonna sleep so i can wake up at 6am<br>

my parents said no to every house i like and the pretty house with the built in library has been sold <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LKHDThNB3y7Uk/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e475iakyhbp66kgbmj19zmenon81h56rmpvpf26uvir&ep=v1_stickers_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=s" alt="emoji" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; vertical-align: middle;"> perch it wasnt an option but im still sad. it was perfect to me. the house with the other two houses is still an option. the other two they like are way too modern it actually upsets me tbh. deep down inside i want them to choose that one. the one with three houses. i miss you. ngl i do NOT want you to find anyone else but i wouldn't hate you if you did. i was able to study more today. i havent been studying enough. i want to start waking up early again and sleeping much earlier.  i like the song "dumb" because i think im dumb UHVIUIHF i also can use stickers as emojis now hehe <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExOXpwOGd2MDJzY3JrcGMxOXl5YmdsdjN6dHN2dHJyMTlwdW9mb2ZrMiZlcD12MV9zdGlja2Vyc19zZWFyY2gmY3Q9cw/wIUQQ07BHzDry/giphy.gif" alt="emoji" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; vertical-align: middle;"> i really like the artist paris paloma her songs are very fantasy feminism hahhacd i see the vision shes underrated even tho she has 7M listeners. i never wanted to break up. i stayed and came back because i want you. sorry i couldnt forgive and be what you need. you deserve the best. i hope you had a great day. ill try not to text. it hurts. im also praying for your appointment tomorrow. youre in every single one of my prayers. goodnight pretty boy<3 im sorry for everything. you never deserved to get hurt.

 i started playing my instruments again just not as much as id like. im actually a really fast learner. perch i only need to listen to a song once and ill be able to play it by ear no tabs or sheet music needed *tiktok smirk emoji* <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/EGNi09y1CXeyA/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47av09oc5ejfyy7n38al6zymx7caun7xsuuc098sqs&ep=v1_stickers_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=s" alt="emoji" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; vertical-align: middle;"><br><br> This feels like those mood entries from victorious LOL. i  like it ngl. This song makes me feel like im a mermaid/fairy/princess in a book. i hate all the girls you "bantered" with. if im being honest i hope they die in the worst way possible. i also hate that you joked about wanting someone else. ill forever hate it. I HATE IT SO MUCH. yet i still cant hate you. if you really liked me you wouldn't have said you wanted someone else. it makes no sense as to why this would be a joke. it doesnt make me sad anymore im just upset. about everything. i cant handle it<br><br> i wish i wasn't sexual with you. i think i encouraged it more and it ended up hurting me. im dying because i always told girls not to do that BECAUSE THEYD FEEL LIKE THIS HAHAH at least to not do it until they're sure this is who they'll marry and stuff. it hurts because that happened while you joked with other girls. in my head, i thought you were different, and i still do think youre different. it just hurt a lot because youd ask for certain things while doing that and it would hurt every time. i still hurt thinking about that. it's just something that most people do so i was like woah this guy isnt like this that's so cool yk:0 i know this is most common among girls because we're the ones that get asked this by most guys. if you read this i hope it doesn't hurt you and you don't feel bad. i dont want to hurt you. i just feel dumb and perch ill admit this was a dumb thing to do. i mentioned that i wasnt sure you'd understand because guys dont have this happen to them very often but every guy has done this to me and many girls. it's not the fact that you asked asked that hurts me. it's the fact that you did it while saying you wanted someone else-- that's what hurts. i know you said you didn't think i liked you. im sorry i made you feel that. ill forever regret doing that. i just thought that maybe we were becoming official because i assumed you weren't like the others so when it happened it just hurt a lot. it felt like maybe you didn't really want me at all. im not sure how to described it but it felt like you wanted to use me. im bad at communication so i never talked to you about it but it's also because i dont see why id try to fix things after that. i hope that makes sense. i'd rather leave than get hurt. i think this will always be in the back of my head along with many other things. i know you proably understand what i mean you told me you feel like this as well. im sorry i made you feel this way. i need to stop being so depressing here *dead emoji* SHE PLAYS BASSSS SHE PLAYS BASSS NOTHING MATTERS CAUSE WE'RE BOTH IN SPACE<br><br>I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate

i feel bad that sometimes compliments make me insecure. it's not that i dont like getting complimented. im not sure what it makes me feel. maybe i just dont believe it. certain things are still in the back of my mind. i feel bad that i still feel this way it's not good. it makes it hard for me to believe things. i wonder if ill get over it. i started developing a hatred towards random girls i never knew and will never know just because you talked to them which isn't a bad thing from your part. why do i not tell you this directly? perhaps it's because im not ready to talk about it. im not sure myself. all i know is that it makes me feel dumb and weak. i know im not weak or dumb. im actually kinda cool *running emoji* it's really hard for me to open up. i feel annoying and it's something im working on. i know you say im not, but it's really hard for me to believe some things. i hate hating people. it makes my stomach and heart hurt. it's not really a feeling id wish on anyone. i feel like throwing up when i think about it or other stuff from the past or even recent. ive been told that talking about it helps with this feeling and ill get over it eventually but maybe im just built different. the more i talk about it, the more it hurts. i dont feel any sort of change or progress from doing so. i feel weak rn. i wasnt able to get the bestest sleep. i still feel really anxious. im tired. <br> it's 10 pm now and i cant sleep.i feel tired and im typing here again to distract myself from tweaking LOL this is one of my hobbies now ig. i want to add more to this website im just not sure yet maybe one of these days ill do it when i think of something. i didnt close this tab just in case i wanted type some more. i feel like im talking to you or sending you a letter USHFSEHFSKF. Goodnight Ivan. i typed "goodnight" and it automatically suggested your name. you're everywhere in my life. GNNNNN

    I miss you. you said you went to sleep. I hope and pray you stop feeling sad. You deserve to never feel sad. I wish i could take your sadness away. i hope and pray we can get the house with the apartments it would be so cool and wed have an option of a place for you if we're together. mannnn i miss you:( IM OBSESSED WITH SONGS THAT MAKE ME FEEL LIKE IM IN A PRINCESS OR IN A FANTASY WORLD HAHAH. I wish i was a fictional character. real life isnt the bestest sometimes. I want to start over. I think im a mess. I wish you met me while i wasnt this way. I was better before. <br> i always feel so anxious i feel like im not good enough and its actually killing me and idk what to do about it.
