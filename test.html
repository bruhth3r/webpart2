i feel bad that sometimes compliments make me insecure. it's not that i dont like getting complimented. im not sure what it makes me feel. maybe i just dont believe it. certain things are still in the back of my mind. i feel bad that i still feel this way it's not good. it makes it hard for me to believe things. i wonder if ill get over it. i started developing a hatred towards random girls i never knew and will never know just because you talked to them which isn't a bad thing from your part. why do i not tell you this directly? perhaps it's because im not ready to talk about it. im not sure myself. all i know is that it makes me feel dumb and weak. i know im not weak or dumb. im actually kinda cool *running emoji* it's really hard for me to open up. i feel annoying and it's something im working on. i know you say im not, but it's really hard for me to believe some things. i hate hating people. it makes my stomach and heart hurt. it's not really a feeling id wish on anyone. i feel like throwing up when i think about it or other stuff from the past or even recent. ive been told that talking about it helps with this feeling and ill get over it eventually but maybe im just built different. the more i talk about it, the more it hurts. i dont feel any sort of change or progress from doing so. i feel weak rn. i wasnt able to get the bestest sleep. i still feel really anxious. im tired. <br> it's 10 pm now and i cant sleep.i feel tired and im typing here again to distract myself from tweaking LOL this is one of my hobbies now ig. i want to add more to this website im just not sure yet maybe one of these days ill do it when i think of something. i didnt close this tab just in case i wanted type some more. i feel like im talking to you or sending you a letter USHFSEHFSKF. Goodnight Ivan. i typed "goodnight" and it automatically suggested your name. you're everywhere in my life. GNNNNN
